## About
I am a Veblen Research Instructor at Princeton University and the Institute for Advanced Study since 2016. Before that I was a PhD student at the Einstein Institute of Mathematics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem under the guidance of Prof. Elon Lindenstrauss.

## Researchâ€‹
I work in number theory and homogeneous dynamics. My research revolves around equidistribution of arithmetic objects. This is a broad subject that requires a synthesis of ideas from different fields.  

In a pursuit to
understand equidistribution questions I am studying measure rigidity, arithmetic invariant theory, relative trace formulae and their geometric expansion, sieve methods in multiplicative number theory, subconvexity and
large deviations estimates.

## Teaching
In Fall 2018 I am teaching an [advanced class](https://registrar.princeton.edu/course-offerings/course_details.xml?courseid=013461&term=1192) about Ratner's theorems and their applications in number theory.
