## About
I am a mathematician working in number theory and homogeneous dynamics.
Currently, I am an Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Northwestern University since summer 2019. Before that I was a
a Veblen Research Instructor at Princeton University and the Institute for Advanced Study since 2016.

My research is being supported by a *Sloan Fellowship*, the *NSF* and the *BSF*. Previously, I have been supported by an *AMS Centennial Fellowship*.
I am also a co-PI on the *NSF RTG* grant *Dynamics: Classical, Modern and Quantum*.
