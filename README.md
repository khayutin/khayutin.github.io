## About
I am a Veblen Research Instructor at Princeton University and the Institute for Advanced Study since 2016. Before that I was a PhD student at the Einstein Institute of Mathematics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem under the guidance of Prof. Elon Lindenstrauss.


## Researchâ€‹
I work in number theory and homogeneous dynamics. My research revolves around equidistribution of arithmetic objects. This is a broad subject that requires a synthesis of ideas from different fields.  

In a pursuit to
understand equidistribution questions I am studying measure rigidity, arithmetic invariant theory, relative trace formulae and their geometric expansion, sieve methods in multiplicative number theory, subconvexity and
large deviations estimates for Markov processes.
